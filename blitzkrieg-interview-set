1. Problem: Compress a string such that 'AAABCCDDDD' becomes 'A3BC2D4'. Only compress the string if it saves space.
2. Problem: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
3. Problem: Sort an array of strings so all anagrams are next to each other.
Input: ['ram', 'act', 'arm', 'bat', 'cat', 'tab']
Result: ['arm', 'ram', 'act', 'cat', 'bat', 'tab']

4. Find first missing positive integer (>0)
Input: [3, 4, -1, 1]
Output: 2
Input: [1, 2, 0]
Output: 3

5. Find Peak Element
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Output explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Input: [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]
Output: 1 or 5
Output explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

6. Array rotation/shifting
Rotate array in right (or left) for K places.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3
Output: [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]

7. Sort RGB Array
Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate
the values of the array so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last.
You can only swap elements of the array.
Do this in linear time and in-place.
Input: ['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G']
Output: ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B']

8. Secret Santa
Secret Santa is a game in which a group of friends or colleagues exchange Christmas presents anonymously,
each member of the group being assigned another member for whom to provide a small gift.
You're given a list of names, make a random pairs (each participant should have another name as pair).
Return an array with pairs represented as tuples.
Input: ['a', 'b', 'c']
Output: This is a nondeterministic algorithm, more solutions exists, here are 2 possible solutions:
    [('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), ('c', 'a')], [('a', 'c'), ('c', 'b'), ('b', 'a')]
    
    
9. Product of Array Except Self
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,
return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity?
(The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]

10. Reverse array
Reverse an array, in constant space and linear time complexity.
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
